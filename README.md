# HIV-Classifier
Classifying HIV into subtypes based on their genomic data

We are first going to use hamming distances to differentiate between two different subtypes, and B subtype and the C subtypes using simple logistic regression.
### Convention for converting data
- run *python conversion.py* followed by the fasta file name and location, as well as the csv file name and location to be created
- *python conversion.py data/hivB-gag.fasta data/hivB-gag.csv*
